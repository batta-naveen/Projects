Blood Drop is a UI/UX design project created using Figma to address the growing demand for blood donations. The app aims to provide a centralized platform that connects blood donors with recipients in need. The design focuses on creating a user-friendly interface, educational resources, and a secure messaging system to make the process of finding and connecting with blood donors more efficient, effective, and reliable. The ultimate goal is to save lives by increasing the availability of blood for patients in need while promoting the importance of blood donation.
